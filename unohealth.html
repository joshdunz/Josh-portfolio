        <h1 class="project-short-sum"> Worked with a Medicare benefit startup to 
          make their interface more accessible for the elderly and their caregivers</h1>
        <p>For a class project, my group was matched with Uno Health - a startup that aims 
          to increase accesibility to Medicare. They do so by making it easier to apply 
          for Medicare Savings online through their portal.
        While looking at ways to expand, they realised that leveraging caregivers who were more digitally savy was a key way 
        to lower the barrier-to-entry for this huge market. That's where our team came in.</p>

          <h3 class="info-header"> Creating a happy path</h3>
          <p class="info-para">I from client feedback learned the concept of a happy path - an ideal path through which
            a user would have the best experience. I had the opportunity to put into practice using visual nudges to
            prompt users to follow it and I will apply this concept to future projects.
