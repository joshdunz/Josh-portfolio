        <h1 class="project-short-sum"> Worked with a Medicare benefit startup to 
          make their interface more accessible for the elderly and their caregivers</h1>
        <p>For a class project, my group was matched with Uno Health - a startup that aims 
          to increase accesibility to Medicare. They do so by making it easier to apply 
          for Medicare Savings online through their portal.
        While looking at ways to expand, they realised that leveraging caregivers who were more digitally savy was a key way 
        to lower the barrier-to-entry for this huge market. That's where our team came in.</p>

            <p>Many Medicare eligible members have caregivers or family members
